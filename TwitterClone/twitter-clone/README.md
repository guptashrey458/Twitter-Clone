In this MERN stack project, I am building a Twitter clone that showcases my full-stack development skills. The project includes a robust feature set, from user authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to real-time interactions using Socket.io. I'm handling everything from suggested user recommendations, creating and managing posts, and editing profiles to implementing image uploads through Cloudinary and sending notifications. This project not only emphasizes modern web development practices but also demonstrates my ability to take a complex application from concept to deployment.
